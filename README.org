* HER-LSF-FX

This program is a pure clojure version of HER-LSF using cljfx for the GUI.

** Dependencies

- Java >=11
- Clojure cli
- Optional: babashka (for build tasks)

** Install

Currently it is only possible to build the application from source.
After cloning the repository, you can use

#+begin_src sh
  bb build
#+end_src

or, in case you do not have babashka installed

#+begin_src
  clojure -M:native-image --no-fallback
#+end_src


to compile a native image with graalvm.

If this should fail for any reason, I would appreciate a ticket about it. As a fallback
you can leave out the --no-fallback option to generate a slower version or generate
a jar file with

#+begin_src sh
  bb uberjar
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src sh
  clojure -X:uberjar
#+end_src

** Run

If you just want to start the application without building it, you can use

#+begin_src sh
  bb main
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src
 clojure -M:main
#+end_src
